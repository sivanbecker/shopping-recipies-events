# Project Progress

## Stage 0 — Scaffold — COMPLETE (committed to `main`)
Full project scaffold, all routes, AuthPage, ProfilePage (basic), DB types, migrations, CI, Vercel.

---

## Stage 1 — Authentication & User Profiles — COMPLETE (committed to `main`)

- **Forgot password flow** — AuthPage 3-view state machine: `login | register | forgot`. Calls `supabase.auth.resetPasswordForEmail`, shows success toast, returns to login.
- **ProfilePage** — inline display name edit (save/cancel + keyboard support), language toggle saves to `profiles.preferred_language` via `updateProfile`.
- **`useAuth` extended** — `updateProfile(updates)` writes to DB and updates local profile state. Added `ProfileUpdate` type from `Database['public']['Tables']['profiles']['Update']`.
- **`src/types/database.ts`** — added `Relationships: []` to every table so Supabase v2 client resolves `.update()` types correctly.
- **`src/lib/schemas.ts`** — exports `loginSchema`, `registerSchema`, `LoginData`, `RegisterData`. AuthPage imports from here.
- **i18n** — added keys: `auth.resetPasswordHint`, `auth.sendResetLink`, `auth.resetPasswordSent`, `auth.backToLogin`, `auth.registerSuccess`, `profile.language`, `profile.editName`, `profile.namePlaceholder`, `profile.nameSaved` (both `he` + `en`).
- **Unit tests** (`src/__tests__/auth.test.tsx`) — loginSchema, registerSchema, useAuth hook. All pass.
- **E2E** (`e2e/auth.spec.ts`) — 5 smoke tests (no credentials needed); 2 full auth-flow tests that skip unless `E2E_TEST_EMAIL` + `E2E_TEST_PASSWORD` env vars are set.
- **Test infra** — `src/test/setup.ts` mock exports `isSupabaseConfigured: true`; `vite.config.ts` uses `vitest/config` import; `@types/node` installed + added to `tsconfig.node.json`.

---

## Stage 2 — Products Catalog — COMPLETE (committed to `main`)

- **DB schema** — `categories`, `unit_types`, `products` already defined in `001_initial_schema.sql`; seed data (10 categories, 16 unit types) in `002_seed_data.sql`. No new migration needed.
- **`/products` page** — full implementation replacing the stub: live search bar, category filter chips (scrollable), products grid grouped by category with colored section headers.
- **`ProductCard`** — shows product name (language-aware), category badge with color, shared/personal badge, edit/delete buttons (owner-only, enforced via `created_by === user.id`).
- **"Add Product" dialog** — Hebrew name (required), English name (optional), category select, default unit select (grouped by type: count / weight / volume / cooking). Sheet-style on mobile, centered on tablet+.
- **Edit product** — pre-fills form from existing product values; saves via `UPDATE` with RLS enforcement.
- **Delete product** — confirmation dialog with product name; removes via `DELETE`.
- **`is_shared` flag** — displayed as badge on each card; RLS on Supabase side controls visibility (shared = all users, personal = creator only).
- **TanStack Query** — first real usage: `useQuery` for products/categories/unit_types; `useMutation` for add/update/delete with cache invalidation.
- **i18n** — added `products.*` keys to both `he/common.json` and `en/common.json`.
- **Unit tests** (`src/__tests__/products.test.tsx`) — 8 tests for `filterProducts` (empty query, partial Hebrew/English match, case-insensitivity, null name fallback) + 4 tests for ProductCard name/owner display logic. All 31 suite tests pass.

---

## Stage 2.5 — Bulk Import from CSV / JSON — COMPLETE (committed to `main`)

- **Import button** — toolbar on `/products` page; accepts `.csv` and `.json` files via hidden file input.
- **`src/lib/importProducts.ts`** — `parseImportFile` validates rows with Zod, resolves category/unit names to IDs by Hebrew name, English name, or unit code. Returns `{ toInsert, toUpdate, skipped }`.
- **Duplicate handling (upsert)** — on matching `name_he` or `name_en`:
  - Owner + props changed → `UPDATE` existing product (`category_id`, `default_unit_id`, `name_en`).
  - Owner + no change → skipped as `unchanged`.
  - Not owner → skipped as `duplicateNameHe`.
  - Same name appears twice in the file → second row skipped.
- **`ImportSummaryDialog`** — shows Added / Updated / Skipped counts with per-row reasons. Skipped rows downloadable as CSV for correction.
- **i18n** — `products.import.*` keys (inserted, updated, skipped, reasons) in both `he` and `en`.
- **Unit tests** — 36 product tests covering parser, resolvers, upsert logic, owner guard, within-file dedup. All 55 suite tests pass.
- **DB migration** — `supabase/migrations/003_extra_categories.sql` adds "Health & Pharmacy" (💊 #ec4899) and "Perishables / מתכלים" (🕐 #f43f5e).
- **Sample CSV templates** — `sample_products_import.csv` (English categories/units) and `sample_products_import_he.csv` (Hebrew categories/units).

---

## Stage 2.7 — Add Product to Shopping List (from Products Page) — COMPLETE (committed to `main`)

- **"Add to list" button** — `ListPlus` icon on every `ProductCard`; opens a bottom sheet.
- **Bottom sheet** — lists the user's active (non-archived) shopping lists; quantity stepper (count) or free input (weight/volume); unit chips filtered to the product's unit category; "New List" option creates a list on the fly.
- **Upsert logic** — if the product is already in the selected list (unchecked), bumps quantity; otherwise inserts a new item.
- **Toast** — "Added to [list name]" with a tappable link navigating to that list.
- **i18n** — added `products.addToList.*` keys in both `he` and `en`.

---

## Stage 3 — Shopping Lists (Core) — IN PROGRESS

### 3.1 — DB Migration — COMPLETE
- `shopping_lists`, `list_members`, `shopping_items` tables created in `001_initial_schema.sql`.
- RLS policies in place; indexes on `shopping_items(list_id)` and `shopping_lists(owner_id, is_archived)`.

### 3.2 — Lists Overview Page (`/lists`) — COMPLETE
- Active lists section — cards showing name (or creation date), item count, active badge, missing-list badge.
- Archived section — collapsible toggle, lazy-loaded.
- "New List" FAB opens `NewListDialog`; name defaults to today's date if left blank.
- TanStack Query: separate queries for active and archived lists (archived only fetched when expanded).

### 3.3 — List Detail Page (`/lists/:id`) — COMPLETE
- Header: list name (display-only), back nav, Archive/Reactivate button (owner only).
- Progress bar: "X of Y items picked" with animated fill.
- `AddItemSheet` — two-step bottom sheet: search products → configure quantity + unit → upsert.
  - Upsert: bumps existing unchecked item's quantity; inserts new item otherwise.
  - Inline "Create new product" option when search term has no exact match.
- Item rows: check/uncheck toggle (optimistic spinner), quantity + unit label, delete button.
- Checked items shown with strikethrough + dimmed; FAB hidden on archived lists.
- Empty state with icon illustration.

### 3.4 — Quantity & Units UX — COMPLETE
- Count-type units: +/− stepper capped at minimum 1.
- Weight/volume: free numeric input (min 0.1, step any).
- Unit chips grouped by the product's default unit category; "No unit" chip always available.
- Quantity + unit displayed inline on each item row.

### 3.5 — Archive, Clone & Reactivate — COMPLETE
- `archiveMutation` in `ListDetailPage` toggles `is_archived` / `is_active`; button label and icon swap between Archive ↔ Reactivate.
- **Clone button** — `Copy` icon, owner-only, sits next to the Archive/Reactivate button in the list detail header.
- `cloneMutation` creates a new active list (same name) then bulk-inserts all items with `is_checked: false` and quantities unchanged.
- Toast "List cloned" with an "Open" action that navigates directly to the new list via `useNavigate`.
- i18n: `lists.cloneSuccess`, `lists.open` added in both `he` and `en`.

### 3.6 — Missing Items Quick-Add Flow — COMPLETE
- **"Something missing?" FAB** — amber button on the Lists page; finds or auto-creates an active `is_missing_list` list and navigates to it. Subsequent taps always go to the same list.
- **Pinned at top** — missing list sorts above all other active lists (`order by is_missing_list desc`).
- **"Convert to Shopping List" button** — appears in the ListDetailPage header when viewing a missing list; copies all items to a new regular list then **deletes** the missing list; navigates directly to the new list.
- **`filterProducts` generic** — made `<T extends Product>` so enriched types (`ProductWithUnit`) are preserved through filtering.
### 3.7 — Shopping Mode (In-Store UX) — COMPLETE
- **"Start Shopping" button** — appears below the progress bar on active, non-archived, non-missing lists with items; enters shopping mode.
- **Larger touch targets** — check circle grows from `h-6 w-6` → `h-8 w-8`; row padding `p-3.5` → `p-4`; item name `text-sm` → `text-base`.
- **"In Cart" collapsible section** — checked items collapse under a `ChevronDown` toggle ("In Cart (N)") rather than rendering inline with unchecked items.
- **Delete button hidden** in shopping mode to prevent accidental removals.
- **"Done Shopping" fixed bar** — sits above the bottom nav; tapping opens a confirmation dialog to archive the list or keep shopping.
- **Exit button** — replaces Clone/Archive buttons in the header so users can leave shopping mode without archiving.
- **FAB raised** in shopping mode so it clears the Done Shopping bar.
- **i18n** — added `exitMode`, `inCartSection`, `donePromptTitle`, `donePromptBody`, `archiveAndDone`, `keepShopping` keys (both `he` + `en`).

## Stage 4 — Real-time Sharing — IN PROGRESS

### 4.1 — Invite Users to a List — COMPLETE
- **DB migration 005** — two `security definer` Postgres functions:
  - `find_user_by_email(p_email)` — queries `auth.users` by email (inaccessible to anon key otherwise)
  - `get_list_members(p_list_id)` — fetches list members with joined profile display names
- **Share button** — owner-only `UserPlus` icon button in list detail header
- **ShareListDialog component** — center modal with:
  - Members section: displays member display names + inline role picker (Can Edit / Can View) + remove button
  - Invite section: email input + role selector + Add button
  - Empty state: "Not shared with anyone yet"
  - Error handling: "No account found" / "Already a member" with inline error display
- **Mutations**: `addMemberMutation`, `removeMemberMutation`, `updateRoleMutation` with optimistic updates via TanStack Query
- **Types** — added `list_members` table types + RPC function types; exported `ListMember`, `ListMemberWithProfile`
- **i18n** — 16 new keys under `sharing.*` in both `he` and `en` locales

### 4.2 — Supabase Realtime Subscriptions — COMPLETE
- **Channel subscription** — single channel per list view (`list-detail-${id}`)
  - `postgres_changes` listeners for `shopping_items` (all events) and `shopping_lists` (UPDATE) — no server-side filter, client-side list ID guard
  - `broadcast` listeners for `items-changed` and `list-changed` — the primary cross-user notification path (see below)
- **Root cause of Realtime not working for collaborators:** Supabase Realtime's walrus extension evaluates RLS row-visibility checks in an internal Postgres context where `auth.uid()` cannot be resolved for any user when policies do cross-table joins (`shopping_items` → `list_members` / `shopping_lists`). This caused walrus to silently drop events for ALL subscribers — owners appeared to work only because their mutations called `queryClient.invalidateQueries` on success.
- **Fix — Realtime Broadcast:** After every mutation that changes shared data, the mutating client sends a broadcast event on the same channel. All subscribers receive it and invalidate their query cache. Broadcast bypasses walrus entirely; the subsequent data refetch is still protected by REST-side RLS.
  - `broadcastChange(listId, 'items-changed')` called after add/toggle/remove item mutations
  - `broadcastChange(listId, 'list-changed')` called after archive/reactivate mutation
  - Helper uses `supabase.getChannels()` to find the live channel without passing refs
- **Secondary fix — RLS policy (migration 006):** Rewrote `shopping_items` SELECT policy to use direct subqueries instead of `security definer` helper functions. Avoids the walrus context issue if Supabase ever improves walrus for this schema. Also eliminates any risk of `security definer` bypassing expected RLS context.
- **Explicit Realtime auth:** `supabase.realtime.setAuth(session.access_token)` called before subscribing, guarded by `!session` in the effect. Supabase JS v2 only syncs the JWT to Realtime on `SIGNED_IN`/`TOKEN_REFRESHED`, not on `INITIAL_SESSION` (page-load restore) — explicit call ensures walrus always has the correct JWT.
- **Smart cache updates (postgres_changes path):**
  - DELETE: remove item from cache directly
  - UPDATE is_checked: patch item in-place for instant no-flicker UI feedback
  - UPDATE other fields & INSERT: invalidate queries (need fresh joins from DB)
  - List updates: invalidate both detail and overview list queries
- **Cleanup** — `supabase.removeChannel(channel)` on component unmount
- **Test infrastructure** — fixed Supabase mock to support `removeChannel()` method
- **Tests** — 8 tests verifying channel setup, subscription lifecycle, cache operations
- **Fixes shipped alongside:**
  - Shared lists now appear on the overview page for invited members (removed erroneous `owner_id` filter from `ListsPage` query — RLS handles access control)
  - `ItemRow` now guards against `product: null` for items whose products are private to the owner — shows "—" instead of crashing

### 4.5 — User Avatars & Shared List Social UX — COMPLETE
- **Avatar generation** — installed `boring-avatars` package; deterministic SVG avatars seeded by `user_id`
- **`UserAvatar` component** — renders avatar with optional ring highlight for owner distinction; includes title tooltip
- **`AvatarStack` component** — overlapping avatar display (owner always first, max 3 visible, "+N" for overflow)
- **ProfilePage header** — replaced generic user icon with large avatar next to display name
- **ShareListDialog** — replaced user icons in member rows with avatars; each member shows their unique avatar
- **ListDetailPage header** — added AvatarStack below list name (shows owner + invited members)
- **ListsPage cards** — added AvatarStack below item count (shows owner + invited members)
- **Migration 007** — updated `get_list_members` RPC to return owner + invited members (via UNION query)
- **PR #13** — All changes committed and pushed

### 4.x — List-Level Product Sharing — COMPLETE
- **Issue:** Items with private products (`is_shared=false`) appeared as "—" to list members (RLS blocked the product join)
- **Approach:** Expand products SELECT RLS to allow visibility when two users share any list together
- **Migration 008** — new `USING` clause with 5 conditions:
  1. `is_shared = true` (globally shared, unchanged)
  2. `created_by = auth.uid()` (own product, unchanged)
  3. Creator owns a list the current user is an invited member of
  4. Current user owns a list the creator is an invited member of
  5. Both are invited members of the same list
- **ProductsPage catalog** — explicit `.or('is_shared.eq.true,created_by.eq.{uid}')` filter added so the catalog stays as-is (own + globally shared only)
- **AddItemSheet / Add-to-list** — unchanged; relies on new RLS, automatically surfaces list-mates' private products
- **Product creation** — unchanged; products default to `is_shared: false`, visible to list-mates through RLS

### 4.6 — Item-Level "Added By" Avatar — COMPLETE
- Each item row in `ListDetailPage` now shows a 20px avatar of the user who added the item
- Cross-referenced against the `members` array already loaded in the page — no extra DB query
- `UserAvatar` placed between quantity label and delete button; tooltip shows display name
- Works in both normal mode and shopping mode

---

## Stage 5 — Recipes — COMPLETE (branch: feat/stage-5-recipes, pending merge)

### 5.1–5.5 — Full recipe management — COMPLETE
- **RecipesPage** — list view with live search by title, filter by tool (oven, stovetop, pot, pan, baking tray, blender), and owner-only delete
- **RecipeFormPage** — create/edit recipes with:
  - Metadata: title, description, servings, prep time, tool checkboxes
  - Ingredient builder: product search, quantity, unit, notes, substitute grouping
  - Steps builder: add/remove/reorder preparation steps
- **RecipeDetailPage** — view recipes with:
  - **Servings scaling**: adjust servings spinner → all ingredient quantities scale reactively
  - Ingredient grouping with substitutes (indented, dimmed, `<1>` badge)
  - Preparation steps
  - "Add all ingredients to shopping list" sheet with upsert logic (merges quantities if item already exists)
- **i18n** — 25+ new keys for recipe UI in both `he` and `en`
- **DB Migration 009** — creates `recipes`, `recipe_ingredients`, `recipe_steps` tables with RLS
- **Shared/Personal badges** — recipes default to personal; can be shared

### Known Issues / Design Decisions (to address in future sessions)
1. **Unit mismatch between shopping and recipes:**
   - **Problem:** The same product (e.g., flour) has different units in different contexts:
     - **Shopping context**: measured in packages/units (1, 2, 3 units) — reflects how items are bought
     - **Recipe context**: measured in weight/volume (800g, 2 cups) — reflects culinary measurements
   - **Current behavior:** Recipe ingredient units are independent from product default units. When adding recipe ingredients to a shopping list, the recipe's unit is used (e.g., 800g), not the product's shopping unit (packages).
   - **Example:** 
     - Product "Flour" has `default_unit: units (count)` for shopping
     - Recipe "Cake" lists "Flour: 800g" (weight unit, not packages)
     - When you add cake ingredients to shopping list → "Flour 800g" is added, not "Flour 1 package"
   - **To fix:** Either (a) allow products to have context-aware unit overrides, or (b) add a conversion mapping (e.g., "1 package = 500g"), or (c) show recipe units separately from shopping units in the list

## Dark Mode — IN PROGRESS (branch: `feat/dark-mode`)

### Approach
- Tailwind `darkMode: ['class']` was already configured — activates via `class="dark"` on `<html>`
- `dark:` prefix overrides added alongside existing classes (no full CSS variable refactor)
- Toggle in ProfilePage (moon/sun icon), persisted to localStorage, defaults to OS `prefers-color-scheme`
- FOUC prevention script planned for `index.html`

### Completed
1. `src/index.css` — `.dark { --background: ...; --foreground: ...; }` block added
2. `src/store/useAppStore.ts` — `isDarkMode` + `toggleDarkMode` added, persisted to localStorage
3. `src/App.tsx` — `useEffect` applies/removes `dark` class on `<html>`
4. `src/pages/Profile/ProfilePage.tsx` — dark mode toggle card (sun/moon) + all elements updated
5. `src/components/layout/AppLayout.tsx` — `dark:bg-gray-950` added
6. `src/components/layout/Header.tsx` — full dark mode coverage
7. `src/components/layout/BottomNav.tsx` — full dark mode coverage
8. `src/pages/Auth/AuthPage.tsx` — full dark mode coverage (refactored repeated input/label classes)
9. `src/pages/Lists/ListsPage.tsx` — full dark mode coverage
10. `src/pages/Lists/ListDetailPage.tsx` — full dark mode coverage (items, sheets, dialogs, nav)
11. `src/pages/Lists/ShareListDialog.tsx` — full dark mode coverage
12. `src/pages/Products/ProductsPage.tsx` — full dark mode coverage (sticky search bar, import button, category chips, group badges, ImportSummaryDialog, AddToListSheet list buttons + empty text)
13. `src/pages/Recipes/RecipesPage.tsx` — full dark mode coverage (RecipeCard, ConfirmDeleteDialog, search bar, tool filter chips, empty/loading states)
14. `src/pages/Recipes/RecipeDetailPage.tsx` — full dark mode coverage (header, title/description, meta row, servings spinner, tools, ingredients section, substitutes, steps, ConfirmDeleteDialog, AddToListSheet)
15. `src/pages/Recipes/RecipeFormPage.tsx` — **PARTIALLY DONE** (ProductSearchSheet done; IngredientRow and main form body still need dark: classes)
16. i18n — added `profile.darkMode` / `profile.lightMode` keys in both `he` and `en`

### Still To Do
- `src/pages/Recipes/RecipeFormPage.tsx` — finish remaining elements:
  - `IngredientRow` inputs/selects/text
  - Main form: header (`bg-white border-gray-200`), all inputs/textareas, tools chips, ingredient/step containers, section labels, step number color
- `src/pages/Events/EventsPage.tsx`
- `src/pages/Events/EventDetailPage.tsx`
- `index.html` — FOUC prevention script
- Run `npm test` + `npm run lint` to verify
- Commit and merge to `main`
